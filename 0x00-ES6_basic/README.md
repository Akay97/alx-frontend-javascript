# ES6 Basics Project

## Project Overview
This project is focused on learning and applying key features of **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)**, also known as **JavaScript ES6**. It covers new features introduced in ES6, such as block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template literals, and object property shorthand. Each task is designed to strengthen understanding of modern JavaScript features and concepts.

## Key Concepts
In this project, the following concepts were explored:
- **Constants (`const`) and Variables (`let`)**: Understanding the difference and how to use block-scoped variables.
- **Arrow Functions**: Simplifying function expressions using the `=>` syntax.
- **Rest and Spread Operators**: Working with function parameters and array manipulations.
- **Template Literals**: Using backticks to embed variables in strings.
- **Object Shorthand**: Simplifying object creation using shorthand syntax.
- **Iterators**: Iterating through objects and arrays using `for...of` and other iteration techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js (v12.11.1)**: Used for running JavaScript code in a server environment.
- **npm (v6.11.3)**: Used to manage project dependencies.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit tests.
- **ESLint**: Linter for ensuring consistent JavaScript code quality.
- **Babel**: Transpiler to convert modern ES6+ code into backward-compatible JavaScript.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   Install Node.js 12.11.x in your home directory using the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
