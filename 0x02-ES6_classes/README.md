# ES6 Classes - ALX JavaScript Project

## Description
This project is a series of tasks designed to teach you about ES6 classes, inheritance, and various other ES6 features. Throughout the project, you will implement classes with constructors, getters, setters, and methods while practicing object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn:
- How to define and implement classes in JavaScript.
- The concept of inheritance and extending classes.
- How to use static methods and computed methods.
- Best practices for getters and setters in JavaScript.
- The importance of encapsulation and data privacy in OOP.
- How to handle errors, clone objects, and use symbols in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **NodeJS 12.11.x**
- **Jest** for testing
- **Babel** for ES6 transpiling
- **ESLint** for code linting
